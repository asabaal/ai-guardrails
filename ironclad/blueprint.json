The pattern accounts for alphanumeric characters, periods, hyphens, underscores, and plus signs in the local part, and domain names with subdomains and top\u2011level domains. It then substitutes every match with '[REDACTED]'. Edge cases such as email addresses with quoted local parts, IP literal addresses in the domain part, and internationalized domain names are ignored to keep the regex manageable."

It replaces any matched IP with '[REDACTED]'. Edge cases such as IP addresses embedded in URLs or surrounded by brackets are handled by using word boundaries."

It replaces every match with '[REDACTED]'. The regex is case\u2011insensitive and allows for 10 or 11 digit sequences. It does not attempt to validate phone number length beyond basic structure to avoid excessive complexity."
