      - "Hence"
      - "So"
      - "Consequently"
    examples:
      - "Therefore, apples support digestion."

  circular_reasoning:
    description: "Self-referential statements that assume their own conclusion"

      - "I know the book is trustworthy because it says it is trustworthy."
    detection_patterns:

      - "[X] is true because [X]"

# Entity Relationship Types
relationship_types:
  has_property:
    description: "Entity possesses a characteristic"

      - "Apples have fiber"
      - "Triangles have three sides"
    
  supports:
    description: "Entity enables or helps another entity"
    examples:
      - "Fiber supports digestion"
    
  is_a:
    description: "Classification or categorization"
    examples:
      - "A snake is oviparous"
      - "This shape is a triangle"
    
  causes:
    description: "Causal relationship between entities"
    examples:
      - "Rooster causes sunrise" (fallacious)
    
  temporal_precedence:
    description: "One entity occurs before another in time"

      - "Book says it is trustworthy"
    
  should_trust:
    description: "Recommendation for confidence or belief"
    examples:
      - "We should trust the book"

# Logical Fallacy Types
fallacy_types:
  non_sequitur:
    description: "Conclusion does not follow from premises"
    detection: "Conclusion lacks logical connection to premises"
    example: "Triangles have three sides. This shape has four sides. Therefore, this shape is a triangle."
    
  false_cause:
    description: "Assuming causation from correlation"
    subtypes:
      - post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc: "After this, therefore because of this"
    detection: "Temporal relationship interpreted as causal"
    example: "Rooster crows before sunrise. Therefore, rooster causes sunrise."
    
  equivocation:
    description: "Using ambiguous terms with different meanings"
    detection: "Key term changes meaning between premises"
    example: "Only man is rational. No woman is a man. Therefore, no woman is rational."
    
  circular_reasoning:
    aliases:
      - begging_the_question
    description: "Argument assumes what it's trying to prove"
    detection: "Premise and conclusion are essentially the same"
    example: "Book is trustworthy because it says it is trustworthy."
